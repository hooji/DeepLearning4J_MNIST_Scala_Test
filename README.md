# WIP

This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.

# First Results:

The training shows progress lines in the standard-output. And the end, some results of the MNIST classifier using a Multi-Layer-Perceptron in the [./mlp](./mlp) subdirectory:

# Visualization of the progress of the Training of the Neural Network by DeepLearning4J

DeepLearning4J has a web UI integrated on top of an embedded Eclipse Jetty web server, which allows to visualize many things during the training. For example, the activations at:

       http://localhost:<jetty-port>/activations

(DeepLearning4J can automatically open this URL for you, so you don't need to know the actual `<jetty-port>` it is using or open this link in your web browser).

Near the last subset of paths, the t-SNE ones (`/tsne/` in the DeepLearning4J UI) is exposed in https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/ and in 'Visualizing Data using t-SNE', by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton ( [http://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf) ).
